# Spooky Hall

## About Game

You are the electrician, the fuse of the hall is broken. Your task is to collect the fuse and drop it to the elctric box for repairing it. But, it isn't easy, as there are some catches;

1. You can only carry certain number of fuse at a time determined by your bag capacity.
2. There are ghosts pumpkin all around, if they touch you you lose one life, you have total of only 3 lives.

## Original Plan

My original plan with the idea was to create the game in night mode and the concept was that the player has a flashlight with limited battery. The player is dropped in a dark hall where ghost randomly appears. The player should collect all the fuses and repair the electric box to turn on the lights, before his flashlight discharges. The ghost could see in dark to certain range and kill the player if they are in that range. Also, the ghost hear sounds and move towards the player.

### What went wrong?

1. I completed the ghost logic, ghost follows men and flashlight logic too.
2. But, I couldn't create a light that subtracts the background darkness. I tried using blendmodes but it didn't work. So, I improvised.
